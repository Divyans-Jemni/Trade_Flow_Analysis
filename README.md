# Trade_Flow_Analysis
Introduction
As global trade evolves, understanding the metrics that drive it becomes crucial. By examining merchandise trade indices over time, this analysis seeks to answer an important question: "What will shape the next era of global trade—tariffs or strategic alliances—and who is leading the way?"

The following sections explore the dataset containing annual trade indices, focusing on regions, countries, and trade partners. Through data analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, identify key indicators, and make inferences that could be valuable for trade policy, economic forecasts, and business decisions.

The conclusion of this analysis will provide insights into how we can interpret these trade patterns and predict future global trade behavior.

Why This Dataset?
The dataset selected for this analysis is sourced from the World Trade Organization (WTO), providing detailed information on merchandise trade indices over several years. There are several key reasons for choosing this dataset:

Relevance to Global Trade Patterns: The WTO's dataset offers comprehensive insights into the annual trade performance of different regions, countries, and trade partners. With trade being a key factor influencing global economics, understanding the dynamics in this dataset helps us grasp how trade flows are evolving over time.

Global Scope: This dataset spans multiple regions and countries, including economic blocks like the European Union, Africa, and LDC exporters. This diversity in trade data allows us to analyze a wide range of economic behaviors and trends across the world.

Timeliness and Consistency: The data is updated annually, which ensures we are working with the most current trade performance figures. By analyzing this time-series data, we can track shifts in global trade patterns and understand the impact of global events on trade.

What Are We Trying to Figure Out?
Our primary objective with this dataset is to uncover key patterns and trends in global merchandise trade. More specifically, we are aiming to:

Identify Trade Patterns: By examining the trade indices over time, we can identify which regions and countries have seen growth or decline in their trade volumes. This can give us insights into the economic health of specific regions.

Assess the Impact of Geopolitical and Economic Events: We will look for any significant shifts in trade data that might be linked to major global events, such as economic crises, trade agreements, or geopolitical tensions.

Predict Future Trends: By analyzing historical data, we hope to build predictive models that can help forecast future trends in global trade. This could be particularly valuable for policymakers, businesses, and analysts looking to make data-driven decisions regarding trade policies or market opportunities.

Step 1 - Data Preparation
🧭 Initial Data Preparation and Feature Setup
This section begins by importing the necessary Python libraries and loading the trade dataset. The focus is on four major economies — United States, India, Japan, and China — to keep the scope focused yet representative of global trade dynamics.

To prepare the dataset for modeling:

We select key columns like Value, Year, Reporter, and Partner
Remove rows with missing values to preserve data integrity
Sample a manageable number of rows (2000) for efficient computation
Convert country and partner names to numeric codes using label encoding
Standardize the year variable so that it contributes evenly to the regression model
🧠 LabelEncoder transforms text into numerical format for modeling
📊 StandardScaler standardizes the year for scale-consistent regression
🔄 Sampling enables faster runtime while keeping the data representative

These steps ensure our dataset is numeric, cleaned, and balanced — essential for reliable Bayesian modeling.


📊 Step 2: Parameter Estimation (Per Country)
🔍 Country-wise Bayesian Estimation
Here, we build a separate Bayesian model for each country to estimate its trade behavior in isolation. For every country, we define:

A prior for the average trade value (mu)
A prior for the uncertainty or fluctuation in trade (sigma)
A likelihood that assumes trade values follow a normal distribution
We then run MCMC sampling to estimate the posterior distribution of mu and sigma, and finally generate predictions using posterior predictive sampling.

🧠 pm.Normal() defines a normal prior belief
🔁 pm.sample() uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the posterior
🔮 sample_posterior_predictive() allows us to generate simulated trade values

These independent models help us understand each country's baseline trade activity and variability before combining them in a hierarchical structure.

🧮 Step 3: Hierarchical Modeling
🏗️ Building a Hierarchical Bayesian Model
In this step, we shift from individual models to a hierarchical one. This model:

Introduces a global mean and variance (mu_global, sigma_mu)
Allows each country to have its own parameters (mu[i], sigma[i])
Links country-specific parameters to the global distribution
This structure lets countries with limited data "borrow strength" from the global trends, which improves stability and interpretability.

🧠 Hierarchical models balance local detail with global structure
🔢 Partial pooling reduces overfitting by constraining individual deviations
🔁 pm.Normal(..., shape=n_reporters) creates multiple parallel priors

The result is a powerful model that respects country differences while benefiting from shared information.

📈 Step 4: Bayesian Regression Analysis
📈 Modeling Trade Trends Over Time
This section extends the hierarchical model by incorporating a time trend. We introduce:

Country-specific intercepts (alpha) and slopes (beta)
A global average intercept (alpha_global) and slope (beta_global)
A regression formula: trade value = intercept + slope × year
Each country is allowed to grow (or decline) at its own rate, but all still influence the global trend.

⏱️ Standardized years prevent one feature from dominating
📊 beta captures how fast or slow trade is changing each year
🔄 Hierarchical priors ensure countries with fewer records still get robust estimates

This time-aware model helps us forecast and explain how trade is evolving over the years for different economies.

Step 5: Scenario Simulation
🔮 Projecting Trade Futures with Bayesian Simulation
Now that the model understands how each country behaves over time, we use it to simulate future trade values. We:

Select future years like 2025, 2026, and 2030
Pull from the model's posterior samples for alpha, beta, and sigma
Generate a distribution of possible trade values for each country and year
This helps us not only forecast the most likely trade value, but also understand the range of possible outcomes.

🧠 Monte Carlo simulation = repeated sampling to see likely scenarios
📊 We compute mean, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile to summarize uncertainty
🌐 simulate_future_trade() encapsulates the logic for future forecasting

These results form the basis for interpreting how different nations may perform economically under current trajectories.

🧪🔮 Step 6: Advanced Scenario Simulation with Economic Factors
Here we test hypothetical changes in the global economy using scenario-based simulation. Each scenario (e.g., trade war, recession) modifies:

Growth rates (beta) for relevant countries
Volatility (sigma) to reflect stability or instability
We simulate many possible futures (Monte Carlo) to visualize how trade values would behave under each policy.

💼 Scenarios like "US Reverse Tariffs" simulate policy impacts
📉 Recession scenarios decrease beta and increase sigma
🧮 The model adapts its parameters to reflect these economic shocks

This is a powerful use of Bayesian inference: we can test ideas without waiting for them to happen in real life.
